 # Memory Management o9n Python
 Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program.
 
 #Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other objects.
Assume a case where no reference is pointing to an object in memory i.e. it is not in use so, the virtual machine has a garbage collector that automatically deletes that object from the heap memory .

x = 10
y = x
  
if id(x) == id(y):
    print("x and y refer to the same object")


    
x = 10
y = x
x += 1

if id(x) != id(y):
	print("x and y do not refer to the same object")
    
    
#STACK MEMORY

def func():
		
	# All these variables get memory
	# allocated on stack
	a = 20
	b = []
	c = ""
    
    
#HEAP MEMORY

# This memory for 10 integers
# is allocated on heap.
a = [0]*10
